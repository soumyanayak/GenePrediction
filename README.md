GenePrediction
==============
This repository contains:
--------------------------------------
-Code for analysis algorithms for identification of synteny and gene 

prediction 
-The code uses gene prediction tools like GENSCAN, Augustus, 

GeneMark for the analysis
-Code to develop filters to separate predicted proteins and cDNAs 

from the above data
-Code for generating Circos diagrams for synteny
-Code for analyzing and stitching selected genes of Amaranthus 

Hypochondriacus to obtain the cDNA from the given DNA 
-Code for Functional Characterization and Profiling of Genes in the 

Lysine Pathway
-Code for Phylogenetic analysis using multiple sequence alignment of 

AK gene paralogs from diverse species
